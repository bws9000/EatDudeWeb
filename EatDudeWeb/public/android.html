              <p>
              This app was intended for people who would like all their  takeout menus organized conveniently in one place you can take with you  everywhere and for restaurant owners to keep an &ldquo;up to the minute&rdquo; updated menu  available for smartphone users. The menus are created, managed and served to  this app from eatdude.com. Visit eatdude.com for more details.</p>
              <h3>Menus</h3>
              <p>
              Please contact us if we are missing your favorite restaurant  menu. We&rsquo;ll do everything we can to get it added into the system.Â  Send any details to <a href="mailto:admin@eatdude.com">admin@eatdude.com</a> and we will email you  back when the menu is available or add a menu free at eatdude.com.</p>
              <h3>How to use this app</h3>
              <p>
              The idea is to find the restaurant you want, view the menu and  call in your order. It does not send the order to the restaurant. At this time  it is just a take-out menu on your device. After making the call you can hit  the back button and browse the menu while you are on the phone or before you  make the call.</p>
              <h3>Restaurants</h3>
  <p>Menus can be created and managed by restaurant owners. Every  restaurant added to the system is contacted, verified and given the opportunity  of full control over every aspect of their menu including the option to not  have one listed. The basic free functionality and point of this system is  listing menus that can be managed easily and updated via the internet by the  owners of the menu making them available to mobile clients.</p>
              <h3>Errors</h3>
              <p>
              If you receive an &ldquo;Internet Connection Error&rdquo; message you  are not connected to the internet or the menu server is experiencing a  temporary down time. </p>
