              <p>Welcome to Eat Dude mobile restaurant menus. Our goal is to make the accessibility of restaurant menus more convenient. Our menu management application is a great way for restaurant owners to maintain their menus and give &quot;up to the minute&quot; updates to mobile devices. </p>
              <p>I got tired of sorting through my stack of takeout menus one day and just wanted them to be in one place I could access quickly and conveniently. I also wanted my &quot;stack of menus&quot; when I was away from home. I just wanted an easy way to store them on my phone, find what I wanted, click a button and call when I was ready to order.</p>
              <p> If your favorite restaurant isn't listed contact us with the details. If you want to add a menu to the system or received an  invite code to manage a current menu sign-in with your free google account.            </p>
